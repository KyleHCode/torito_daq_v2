This repository contains the firmware for the SOAR Torito Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. The DAQ runs primarily on a Teensy 4.1 and is responsible for reading pressure sensors through an I2C multiplexer and external ADCs, collecting temperature data over SPI, communicating with the control-system ESP via UART, transmitting live telemetry over LoRa, and logging all test data to the onboard SD card during Cold Flow and Static Fire operations. The codebase is structured using PlatformIO to support clean bring-up, team collaboration, and future migration to a real-time operating system as system complexity and timing requirements grow.
